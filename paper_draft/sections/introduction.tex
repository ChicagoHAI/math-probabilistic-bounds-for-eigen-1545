\section{Introduction}

The study of random matrices has become increasingly central to many areas of mathematics, statistics, and theoretical computer science. Understanding the behavior of eigenvalues for random matrices is crucial for applications ranging from principal component analysis to wireless communications \cite{tao2012topics}.

Classical results such as Wigner's semicircle law \cite{wigner1958distribution} describe the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues for certain random matrix ensembles. However, many modern applications require non-asymptotic bounds that hold with high probability for matrices of finite size \cite{vershynin2018high}.

In this paper, we develop new concentration inequalities for the eigenvalues of random matrices with independent entries. Our bounds improve upon existing results in several ways:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We obtain sharper constants in the exponential tail bounds
    \item Our results apply to a broader class of random matrix distributions
    \item We provide explicit bounds for individual eigenvalues, not just the spectral norm
\end{enumerate}

The paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} reviews necessary background and establishes notation. Section \ref{sec:main_results} presents our main theoretical results. Section \ref{sec:applications} discusses applications, and Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with open problems.
