We present new probabilistic bounds for the eigenvalues of random matrices. Our main results establish sharp concentration inequalities for the spectral norm and individual eigenvalues of matrices with independent random entries. We derive these bounds using a combination of matrix perturbation theory and probability techniques. The results improve upon existing bounds in several parameter regimes and have applications in covariance estimation, compressed sensing, and random graph theory. We demonstrate the tightness of our bounds through numerical experiments and provide concrete examples where they outperform classical results.
