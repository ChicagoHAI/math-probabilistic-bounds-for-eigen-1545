\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have established new concentration inequalities for the eigenvalues of random matrices that improve upon existing bounds in several ways. Our results are sharp, as demonstrated by the matching lower bound in Theorem \ref{thm:lower}.

Several interesting open problems remain:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extending the results to dependent entries
    \item Obtaining similar bounds for other matrix ensembles
    \item Improving the constants in the exponential tail bounds
\end{enumerate}

We believe these directions will be fruitful for future research.
