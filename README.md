> Develops sharper concentration inequalities for eigenvalues of random matrices with independent entries, improving upon existing bounds with explicit constants and broader applicability.

## Abstract

We present new probabilistic bounds for the eigenvalues of random matrices. Our main results establish sharp concentration inequalities for the spectral norm and individual eigenvalues of matrices with independent random entries. We derive these bounds using a combination of matrix perturbation theory and probability techniques. The results improve upon existing bounds in several parameter regimes and have applications in covariance estimation, compressed sensing, and random graph theory. We demonstrate the tightness of our bounds through numerical experiments and provide concrete examples where they outperform classical results.

## Key Contributions

1. For n×n random matrices with sub-gaussian entries, the spectral norm concentrates around 2K√n with exponential tail bounds
2. Individual eigenvalues concentrate around their expectations with sub-gaussian tail bounds
3. The bounds are tight as shown by matching lower bounds
